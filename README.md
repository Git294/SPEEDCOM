## Overview

_SPEEDCOM_ is an open source python package that aims to predict the fluorescence emission and absorption spectra of small conjugated organic molecules. These features are predicted using a neural network, implemented with [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), and are trained on data from the [PhotochemCAD database](http://www.photochemcad.com/PhotochemCAD.html). The software has a graphical-user-interface (GUI) where users can input the [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) string for a given molecule and be returned its predicted spectra.
